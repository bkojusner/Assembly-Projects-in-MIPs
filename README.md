# Assembly-Projects-in-MIPS
Class work for my Computer Organization class

Project 1 was practice with converting from programming in C to programming in Assembly. It is a simply for loop.

Project 2 is is a for loop that when given three positiveintegers x, k and n(1 < n < 1000), the program to computes [(x^k) mod n] using fast  modular  exponentiation.
